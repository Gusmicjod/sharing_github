    "The most common way to place statues is to place them on majestic plinths. Depending on the dimensions of the statue, the base must be more or less high and offer a more or less large surface to put the statue there\n",
    "\n",
    "A plinth is thus made up of floors: each floor having a height equal to one unit and a depth equal to two units. the width of the floors decrease by one unit from one floor to the next\n",
    "\n",
    "`floor's_volume = height*depth*width`\n",
    "\n",
    "However, statues builders often find it difficult to estimate the amount of concrete needed to build each plinth. To help them you are asked to write a program that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* requires two integers, representing the width of the plinth at ground level and the width of the plinth at the highest level\n",
    "* then calculate and prints the volume of the plinth"
